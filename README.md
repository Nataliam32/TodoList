# TodoList

Todo List is an app built for those people who want to organize their taks in an easy and elegant way. 
The main focus of this project is usability, so there are not a lot of features in the App. 
Also, the coolest feature is the empty state, feature that gives the user a nice and 
beautiful screen even though there are no activities on screen. 

## Problems and Solutions

The first major problem I've encountered was that some of the built-in functions that I knew were no
longer available, because they were deprecated. So I had to learn how to implement those new functions
provided by Kotlin. A good example of this problem was the replacement of *startActivityForResult*
to *registerForActivityResult*, which are used to get back the result of an activity. This problem 
caused me to postpone the implementation of the edit function, because, on the skill level that I 
am, I cannot accomplish that.
However, when using this same method in another part of my code, I managed to fix all the errors and
use the new function provided by Kotlin, which gave me more confidence to keep studying Kotlin and 
to keep making projects like this one.
